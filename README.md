# FriendTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

A basic Angular project I made following Traversy Media's tutorial but instead of a to-do list/task tracker, I decided to change things up by making a "friend tracker" instead. This is for those people out there who are crazy extroverted and have so many friends that they need an entire Angular project to manage their ever-growing list of friends and family.

This uses JSON-Server to mimic a back end server. It creates API requests to the back end for all changes. You can add a friend, delete a friend (in case you fought over who pays for dinner and called it quits), and you can even double-click on a friend to mark them as a family member so you can spot your family members at a glance <3. Never forget who your loved ones are thanks to this app!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
